Antifungal resistance in rare yeast fungemia across Indian hospitals is concerning. Many yeasts lack database entries in the Bruker MALDI-TOF system, necessitating ITS and LSU sequencing for accurate identification. Statistical modeling was employed to create Main Spectrum Profiles (MSP) for unidentified isolates. Cultures for MSP were incubated on solid media at 37Â°C for 24-48 hours. Antifungal Susceptibility Testing (AFST) followed CLSI M27-A3 guidelines, testing drugs like azoles, echinocandins, and amphotericin B. Statistical analyses were utilized to assess antifungal resistance patterns, identify trends, and determine correlations between species and drug resistance. This informed precise molecular identification and targeted patient care strategies.
